    "# Parametric Estimation\n",

    "In contrast to evaluating the distribution of a random variable in a non-parametric way, a much more popular approach is to assume some known form of the distribution, up to some unknown parameters. For example, a commonly used assumption is that a random variable has a normal distribution with some unknown mean value and standard deviation. We will refer to the form of the distribution, which is assumed to be known, as the model, and our task will be to estimate the values of the unknown model's parameters.\n",
