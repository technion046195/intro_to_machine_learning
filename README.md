## Two suggested options for viewing the notebooks online

### NBViewer - Good for viewing and printing ([link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/technion046195/semester_2019_spring/tree/master/))

The nbviewer makes the notebooks available as static web pages.

### Colab - Good for running, editing and sharing [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/technion046195/semester_2019_spring/blob/master/)

This uses Colabratory, a service from Google which runs a free online free modified version of Jupyter Notebook.
